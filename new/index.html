      <div class="title-underline title-underline-adjustment"></div>
      <div class="description-container flexDirectionCol alignCenter spaceBetween">
        <p class="description">Hi there. We understand that Tarun is a wonderful 
          student, and the pandemic situation likely caused 
          many hurdles in the learning journey over the 
          past year.</p>
        <p class="description">We believe that the right intervention and the right 
          modes of learning, practice and testing would enable 
          every child to become a better version of themselves.</p>
        <p class="description">With that awareness, and the knowledge and tools to 
          identify learning patterns and skills, we have designed 
          this diagnostic test to help identify where and what the 
          learning gaps are.</p>
        <p class="description">To enable students to make up for such losses, we 
          have designed bridge courses that deal with 
          pre-requisites and topics that are critical for science 
          and mathematics in current and future grades.</p>
        <p class="description">This diagnostic test is designed with 20 questions that 
          probe different skill areas and critical concepts from 
          the previous grade across various levels of difficulty.</p>
        <p class="description">This report is an attempt to make you aware of gaps, if 
          any, and to reassure you that we are here to help.</p>

          model with feedback from multiple parents and students to build the BYJU’S 
          Bridge-Classes.</p>

        <p class="description-2">We understand that the pandemic might have led to forgetting the basics, not 
          strengthening the foundations, not having practiced enough and skilled up to 
          apply concepts learnt. The purpose of this diagnostic test was to identify gaps in 
          learning across concepts and skills.</p>

        <div class="description-2">
          <p class="subtitle-2">How can this help Tarun ?</p>
          <p class="mt5">The Bridge Course is a set of classes that Tarun can take to address these gaps. 
          The two-teacher session-format - one for guidance, doubt-solving and practice 
          - and another for delivering conceptual clarity through well-crafted videos - 
          along with strong support from Tarun’s mentors would help Tarun cope up 
          before exploring topics in the current grade.</p>
