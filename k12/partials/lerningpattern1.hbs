          3.Chemistry <span class="{{chemistry_score.value}} bold-font">({{chemistry_score.value}}):</span> Chemistry is the study of matter, its
          properties, how and why substances combine or separate to form other
          substances, and how substances interact with energy. A good score in
          Chemistry indicates that you are satisfactorily skilled at
          understanding the basics of chemistry. This skill will prove very
          useful in dealing with Physical, Inorganic, and Organic Chemistry of
          Class 11 and 12. Keep the skill sharp by always revising the
          concepts you learn.
