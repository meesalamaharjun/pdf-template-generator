          Hi there. We understand that Tarun is a wonderful student, and the
          pandemic situation likely caused many hurdles in the learning journey over
          the past year.
        </p>
        <p class="description">
          We believe that the right intervention and the right modes of learning,
          practice and testing would enable every child to become a better version
          of themselves.
        </p>
        <p class="description">
          With that awareness, and the knowledge and tools to identify learning
          patterns and skills, we have designed this diagnostic test to help
          identify where and what the learning gaps are.
        </p>
        <p class="description">
          To enable students to make up for such losses, we have designed bridge
          courses that deal with pre-requisites and topics that are critical for
          science and mathematics in current and future grades.
        </p>
        <p class="description">
          This diagnostic test is designed with 20 questions that probe different
          skill areas and critical concepts from the previous grade across various
          levels of difficulty.
        </p>
        <p class="description">
          This report is an attempt to make you aware of gaps, if any, and to
          reassure you that we are here to help.

          We understand that the pandemic might have led to forgetting the basics,
          not strengthening the foundations, not having practiced enough and skilled
          up to apply concepts learnt. The purpose of this diagnostic test was to
          identify gaps in learning across concepts and skills.

          <p class="subtitle-2">How can this help Tarun ?</p>
          <p class="mt5">
            The Bridge Course is a set of classes that Tarun can take to address
            these gaps. The two-teacher session-format - one for guidance,
            doubt-solving and practice - and another for delivering conceptual
            clarity through well-crafted videos - along with strong support from
            Tarun’s mentors would help Tarun cope up before exploring topics in the
            current grade.
