          Assessment is a continuous process which does not end with just an evaluation. In fact this is just the

        </p>
        <p>
          Having identified improvement areas, you need to ask yourself the following questions:
        <ul class="learning-tips">
          <li>What is the objective? How can I define the goal that I am aiming for?</li>
          <li>What specific methods will I enrol? For example if classes / seminars / Workshops are required then what
            exactly?</li>
          <li>What time frame is realistic for my goals ?</li>
          <li>What resources do I require to make my development happen in a sustained manner?</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
