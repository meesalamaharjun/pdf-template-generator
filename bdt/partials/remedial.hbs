      We understand that the pandemic might have led to forgetting the basics,
      not strengthening the foundations, not having practiced enough and skilled
      up to apply concepts learnt. The purpose of this diagnostic test was to
      identify gaps in learning across concepts and skills.

      <p class="subtitle-2">How can this help Tarun ?</p>
      <p class="mt5">
        The Bridge Course is a set of classes that Tarun can take to address
        these gaps. The two-teacher session-format - one for guidance,
        doubt-solving and practice - and another for delivering conceptual
        clarity through well-crafted videos - along with strong support from
        Tarun’s mentors would help Tarun cope up before exploring topics in the
        current grade.
